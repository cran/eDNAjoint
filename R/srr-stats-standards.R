#' @srrstatsNA {G1.2} I attempted to add lifecycle statements with the
#'   lifecycle package but was getting ROxygen errors when doing
#'   `usethis::use_lifecycle()`. It would be nice to get some guidance on the
#'   best way to do this.
#' @srrstatsNA {G1.4a} There are no non-exported functions.
#' @srrstatsNA {G1.6} This software makes no performance claims.
#' @srrstatsNA {G2.4b} It didn't seems obvious where to put as.numeric, as many
#'   of my function input checks tested if values that are expected to be
#'   numeric are in fact numeric.
#' @srrstatsNA {G2.4d,G2.4e} I don't believe I have anything that should be a
#'   factor in my functions.
#' @srrstatsNA {G2.5} There are no inputs of type 'factor' in this software.
#' @srrstatsNA {G2.6} I do not believe this applies but would be interested in
#'   guidance as to where I can implement this.
#' @srrstatsNA {G2.9} I do not belive I am doing any type conversions that
#'   could result in lost data.
#' @srrstatsNA {G2.11,G2.12} I do not believe this applies but would be
#'   interested in guidance as to where I can implement this.
#' @srrstatsNA {G2.14a,G2.14b,G2.14c} NAs in data input are meaningful and
#'   should not create an error, nor be imputed
#' @srrstatsNA {G3.1} No covariance methods are used in this software.
#' @srrstatsNA {G3.1a} No covariance methods are used in this software.
#' @srrstatsNA {G4.0} There are no functions that write to local files
#' @srrstatsNA {G5.0} This software is applicable to specific data (i.e., data
#'   from environmental DNA and traditional surveys), so NIST datasets would not
#'   be applicable
#' @srrstatsNA {G5.4a} This software is not proposing a new algorithm and
#'   instead uses functions from the `rstan` package, so it is unclear to me if
#'   and how comparing to a C++ would be useful.
#' @srrstatsNA {G5.4b} This is not a new implementation of an existing method
#' @srrstatsNA {G5.4c} This is not a new implementation of an existing method
#' @srrstatsNA {G5.9, G5.9a} It is unclear to me how to add trivial noise to
#'   the data, since the expected data are all integers.
#' @srrstatsNA {G5.10,G5.11,G5.11a,G5.12} I have not implemented any extended
#'   tests
#' @srrstatsNA {BS1.3b} This software uses Stan that implements only one type
#'   of algorithm (HMC/NUTS)
#' @srrstatsNA {BS1.5} This software enables convergence checks through
#'   interaction with other packages, but does not enable multiple types of
#'   convergence checks itself necessary for comparison
#' @srrstatsNA {BS4.1} This software is not presenting a new sampler
#' @srrstatsNA {BS1.3a, BS2.8} Since all my sampling functions uses `sampling`
#'   from `rstan`, it is unclear how the user could use results from previous
#'   runs to be used as starting points for a new run, although there is a way
#'   for the user to specify initial values (with an example in the vignette)
#' @srrstatsNA {BS2.9} This software uses `rstan`'s `sampling`, which ensures
#'   different seeds are used (from rstan's sampling() documentation: "Even if
#'   multiple chains are used, only one seed is needed, with other chains having
#'   seeds derived from that of the first chain to avoid dependent samples")
#' @srrstatsNA {BS2.10} This software ensures that the same seed is not passed
#'   to multiple computational chains
#' @srrstatsNA {BS2.13, BS2.14} This software uses `rstan`'s `sampling`, and
#'   while it seems possible to suppress all messages/warnings/progress bars, it
#'   is unclear how to suppress just progress bars or just warnings.
#' @srrstatsNA {BS3.2} I do not provide a distinct routine for processing
#'   collinear data, although I give the user a warning if input data has
#'   perfect collinearity
#' @srrstatsNA {BS4.2} It is a bit unclear to me how I would implement
#'   simulation-based calibration, so I would be interested in any tips.
#' @srrstatsNA {BS4.4} This software uses `rstan`'s `sampling`, and it does
#'   not appear to yet be a mechanism of stopping the chain upon convergence
#' @srrstatsNA {BS4.6,BS4.7,BS5.4} This software does not include any
#'   convergence checkers, although I do provide examples of how to examine
#'   convergence in the package vignette.
#' @srrstatsNA {BS5.1} If I'm interpreting this standard correctly, I think
#'   the `rstan` `stanfit` object returns appropriate metadata? i.e., if you are
#'   estimating parameters at 20 sites, the output mu vector would be of length
#'   20
#' @srrstatsNA {BS5.2} Parameters for non-uniform priors are provided by the
#'   user, so it is unclear to me if this would be relevant.
#' @srrstatsNA {BS6.0} The main function, `jointModel()`, returns an object of
#'   class `stanfit`. I would prefer to not print this output, as this software
#'   is focused on a user who may want the actual model output to be abstracted.
#'   I have therefore created `jointSummarize()` so that the user can interpret
#'   the output in terms of the parameters described in the 'About the model'
#'   section of the vignette. If a user prefers, they can inspect the original
#'   `stanfit` object.
#' @srrstatsNA {BS6.1} It is unclear to me which information/return objects
#'   should be plotted
#' @srrstatsNA {BS6.5} Providing joint plotting options seems redundant to
#'   functions in packages like `bayesplot`, but I'm open to suggestions.
#' @srrstatsNA {BS7.0,BS7.1,BS7.2} This software uses `rstan`'s HMC/NUTS
#'   algorithm, where I am assuming that the algorithm will recover expected
#'   prior and posterior distributions. Although I am open to suggestions for
#'   how to test this here.
#' @srrstatsNA {BS7.3} It is unclear to me how to evaluate algorithmic
#'   efficiency, as the MCMC can't be stopped upon convergence with `rstan`'s
#'   sampling, and using something like Sys.time() doesn't seem like it would
#'   provide an accurate estimate of computation time, but I'm open to other
#'   suggestions.
#' @srrstatsNA {BS1.2b, BS1.2c} Vignette was removed from package because
#'   of build size, but textual descriptions of priors and examples can be found
#'   in sections 4.3 and 2.5 in the user guide
#'   (https://bookdown.org/abigailkeller/eDNAjoint_vignette/).
#' @srrstatsNA {G1.5} Vignette was removed from package because of
#'   build size, but example code that reproduces results in the publication
#'   (Keller et al., 2022) where the model/algorithm was first developed can be
#'   found in sections 2.2 and 3.2 in the user guide
#'   (https://bookdown.org/abigailkeller/eDNAjoint_vignette/).
#' @srrstatsNA {BS6.3} Vignette was removed from package because of
#'   build size, but examples of plotting posterior distributional estimates can
#'   be found in sections 2.4.1 and 3.4.1 in the user guide
#'   (https://bookdown.org/abigailkeller/eDNAjoint_vignette/).
#' @srrstatsNA {BS1.4,BS4.3,BS6.2} Vignette was removed from package because of
#'   build size, but examples of convergence checking and plotting posterior
#'   samples can be found in sections 2.4.1 and 3.4.1 in the user guide
#'   (https://bookdown.org/abigailkeller/eDNAjoint_vignette/).
#' @srrstatsNA {BS4.0} Vignette was removed from package because of
#'   build size, but documentation of sampling algorithm can be found in
#'   section 4.2 in the user guide
#'   (https://bookdown.org/abigailkeller/eDNAjoint_vignette/).
#' @srrstatsNA {PD3.0,PD3.1} This package does not manipulate probability
#'   distributions
#' @srrstatsNA {PD3.2,PD3.3,PD3.4,PD3.5,PD3.5a,PD4.3,PD4.4} This package does
#'   not use optimization or integration algorithms
#' @srrstatsNA {PD4.1} The output values of the main statistical functions in
#'   this package are are derived stochastically with MCMC. Additionally,  I use
#'   the HMC MCMC algorithm in the rstan package's sampling function, rather
#'   than my own MCMC algorithm, so I'm not sure I would be able to reproduce
#'   how the output values are derived.
#'
#' Any non-applicable standards can have their tags changed from `@srrstatsTODO`
#' to `@srrstatsNA`, and placed together in this block, along with explanations
#' for why each of these standards have been deemed not applicable.
